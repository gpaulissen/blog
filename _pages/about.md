The idea behind starting my Blog is to share my experience acquired while
working in the computer science.

It may involve technical issues but also non-technical things like my working
experience or the bridge community.

Actually, I have been long wanting to have a personal Blog site. As there are
people who love to talk, I am merely a writer. It helps me to organize my
thoughts and it may help or amuse others, :). And, as a matter of fact I am a
big fan of open standards and exchanging knowledge and ideas.

In the beginning of this year (2019) I proposed to my employer Sogeti to
publish my experience gathered in the testing environment. I was working for
an important client at that time and I had done some thorough research related
to automated testing with Java, Cucumber and Selenium. Really interesting
stuff and the client was very happy with it but after a month of silence my
career change manager (actually my career manager, but I changed my career
thanks to him) told me I could publish something in the private Sogeti
domain. Not actually the answer I was looking for so when a very interesting
opportunity came up to change my career, I took it with both hands.

And the pause between the two employers gave me the time to finally start my
Blog site.
