So when we bought a house in August 2018 near Bordeaux, we decided to have a
swimming pool. We started the inquiries in October 2018.

Well, that took some time. My idea was to have it installed in April 2019 so
the water would have a nice temperature in the summer.

First, we had to choose the swimming pool construction company. I was happy
with the third company but my wife not. She likes to deal so she considered
another company with a self build package. And since she does like to delegate
as well, she asked friends who had constructed a swimming pool not long ago
and who are retired, if they could help us. Luckily the response was very
clear: no, I do not want to risk my back.

Next we had to have permission. That lasted a little bit too long to
my taste but in the beginning of march the government gave us a go. Next, the
neighbours had one month to protest and then ... Well, finally the swimming
pool construction company informed us that they would start 20 May, :(

And then I had to remove the fence in the garden because that would block the
Caterpillar. Well, removing the fence was easy but not the pillars: <br /><img src="/assets/images/swimming-pool/picture-1.jpg" alt="the pillars" width="50%"/>

So I bought the cheapest spade I could find and there I went: <br /><img src="/assets/images/swimming-pool/picture-2.jpg" alt="the spade" width="50%"/>

After an afternoon of work on a rainy day this was the result: <br /><img src="/assets/images/swimming-pool/picture-3.jpg" alt="no obstacles" width="50%"/>

The Caterpillar can now pass thru, let the real work begin, :)
