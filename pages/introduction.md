Hello!

My name is Gert-Jan Paulissen. I am a master of science (computer science, Technical University of Eindhoven, the Netherlands, 1989) and I have been playing bridge since 1977 and won several national titles in the Netherlands. Now I have moved to France where I live in the Bordeaux area with my wife.
